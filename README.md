# EECE5510_Project
Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction example code in MATLAB.  Requires raw data file (Pfile) and DICOM image file.   Demonstrates multiple channel image combination using sum-of-squares (P. Roemer et al.), data apodization techniques, homodyne processing (D. Noll et al.), zero padding/interpolation. Gradient Non-Linearity correction (Gradwarp) not performed. Fred J.
